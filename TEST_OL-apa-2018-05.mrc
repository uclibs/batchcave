Feminist practice is psychology derived from the realities that lie outside, beneath, and at variance from the visions of the dominant patriarchal mainstream. It is an integrative and competency-based paradigm that perceives human beings as responsive to the problems of their lives, capable of solving those problems, and desirous of change. It is also a politically informed model that observes human experience within the framework of societal and cultural realities and through the dynamics of power informing those realities. This book represents an attempt to synthesize feminist therapy's heritage and roots, theory, and modes of practice as they stand in the early 21st century. The model of feminist therapy described in this book is strongly influenced by multicultural and global feminism and by the politics of the social justice movements of feminism, multi-culturalism, and other similar movements working to transform society. Feminist therapy and feminist therapists face the next eight decades of the 21st century wondering how transformations of our understandings of sex and gender, of power and relationships, and of the social and political context of therapy will transform our practice. As a model for psychotherapy, feminist therapy continues to offer the concept that psychotherapy can, and should, be liberatory and that liberation is not simply a freedom from distress but a move toward the power of being able to know and name one's experiences of oppression as well as those of joy."--Preface.

It provides the essential education for psychologists, other mental health providers and professionals from other disciplines to be able to provide culturally competent care to this population of children and their families. In addition, the book lays the groundwork for further dialogue on and research into developing sound practice for working with transgender and gender expansive (TGE) children and their families. All chapters examine the issue of TGE children from the perspectives of the individual, the family, and culture. The book focuses on children; because gender identity develops in early childhood and sexual orientation develops closer to puberty. The book is organized into thirteen chapters. Chapters two through six focus on the individual child in development and psychotherapy. It brings the reader through developmental theories of gender development, provides tools to sharpen skills at differentiating gender identity and expressions, increase consciousness about issues impacting TGE children of color, considers the accompanying psychological factors that often show up alongside gender creativity, and delves into trauma informed practice through the GAM lens. Chapter seven is a comprehensive child and family assessment guide. The next three chapters center on family dynamics and family therapy. Chapters 11 and 12 cover the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and intersectional nature of GAM providers. The final chapter brings up the current limitations of the GAM as well as ideas on where to go from here. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"--Preface.

It is an effort to understand, and ideally to reduce, clinical blindness in psychotherapy. The book systematically addresses unique therapeutic challenges in four different core therapeutic dyads of relative privilege: when therapist and patient share the same social privilege, when privilege favors the therapist, when privilege favors the patient, and when therapist and patient have a similar level of nonprivilege. It explores relevant clinical patterns and dynamics in each of the four core fields of relative privilege and will be helpful in the teaching of issues of diversity, cultural competency, social justice, and awareness of privilege. The book is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of the key concepts discussed in the book. Chapter two introduces readers to the complexities and inconsistencies of privilege and subordination, endeavoring to invite curiosity and self-reflection about one's own privileges and complexities. Each of the subsequent chapters explores, using vignettes, one square from the matrix: Chapter three describes similarity of privilege; Chapters four and five discusses privilege favoring the therapist and privilege favoring the patient; Chapter six explores the situation of similarity of nonprivilege. Chapter seven recounts a longer case that illustrates the complexity of fighting sexism and finding repair in political interpretation. Chapter eight presents a summary and integration of the ideas that have previously arisen with respect to the different relative power situations."--Preface.

This book is organized into four sections. Part I is about foundational concepts and includes presentations of Natural Biology and Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB). Natural Biology grounds IRT case formulation and treatment models in principles of evolution. It presents a reliable and accurate method of pattern recognition in the discussion of SASB. Part II is about the IRT case formulation and treatment models. It provides detail and illustrates the mechanisms that connect a patient's presenting symptoms to perceived current stresses (persistent threat and failure to find safety) and also links those stresses and responses to earlier patterns shaped by lessons in safety and threat. It also provides a review of the IRT treatment model, and describes the phases of the action stage of change. Part III is about applications of the IRT case formulation and treatment models to anger, anxiety, and depression. Part IV provides data on the validity and effectiveness of the IRT case formulation and treatment models."--Preface.

Multiple audiences will find something of value in the varied chapter offerings. Mental health professionals will gain greater familiarity with the conditions confronting prisoners under sentence of death. Corrections officials will learn more about research that has focused on the institutional behavior of prisoners under sentence of death. Members of the legal community--lawyers and judges--and policy advocates will benefit from the insights provided by mental health professionals, corrections personnel, and other chapter authors. The book is organized into four parts comprising 12 chapters. Part I provides an introductory survey of the physical environment and the political and legal landscape of death row, as well as of the treatment of death row inmates. Part II explores constitutional questions that arise in challenges to death row and to the treatment of death-sentenced inmates, as well as the legitimacy and wisdom of the policies that segregate those inmates from others and subject them to long-term solitary confinement. Part III addresses the question, how can a person who has been locked away for extended periods of time under the most adverse possible conditions go about mitigating the pain, ameliorating the stress, and transcending the limited opportunity structure of his stultifying environment? Part IV features the perspectives of individuals who spent years in prison under sentence of death before justice system officials acknowledged their wrongful conviction for capital murder and released them from custody to reenter free society."--Preface (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved). 0aDeath rowzUnited States. 0aDeath row inmateszUnited States. 0aCriminal psychologyzUnited States. 0aCriminal justice, Administration ofzUnited States. 7aSOCIAL SCIENCE / Criminology2bisacsh 7aCriminal justice, Administration of.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00883246 7aCriminal psychology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00883467 7aDeath row.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00888718 7aDeath row inmates.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00888720 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0120415512aCapital Punishment.0(DNLM)D00220322aCriminalsxpsychology.0(DNLM)D057237Q00052322aAttitude to Death.0(DNLM)D001293 2aUnited States.0(DNLM)D014481 4aElectronic books.1 aToch, Hans,eeditor.1 aAcker, James R.,d1951-eeditor.1 aBonventre, Vincent Martin,eeditor.2 aOhio Library and Information Network08iPrint version:z9781433829000w(DLC)  2017049014403APAzConnect to resourceuhttp://content.apa.org/books/2018-13339-000403APAzConnect to resource (off-campus)uhttp://proxy.ohiolink.edu:9099/login?url=http://content.apa.org/books/2018-13339-000  aapa-2018-0504161cam  2200493Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019006001900036007001500055008004100070040003600111020003000147020002700177020003500204020003200239035002200271050002300293082001600316049000900332100003200341245012900373250001900502264006800521300003800589336002600627337002600653338003600679504005100715505063100766506003601397520168601433650002503119650001803144650002303162650005603185650006103241650005203302655002203354710004103376776003203417856007403449856012803523910001603651on1038051635OCoLC20180607113427.0m     o  d        cr |||||||||||180530s2018    dcu     sb    001 0 eng d  aDcWaAPAbengerdacUTBLWdOCLCO  z9781433829192 (print ed.)  z1433829193 (print ed.)  a9781433829208 (electronic bk.)  a1433829207 (electronic bk.)  a(OCoLC)1038051635 4aRA1148b.P734 201804a614/.15223  aOH1A1 aPressman, Mark R.,eauthor.10aSleepwalking, criminal behavior, and reliable scientific evidence :ba guide for expert witnesses /cMark R.

It attempts to provide both the proper scientific and forensic context for the expert witness. The chapters will lead the reader through the different types of scientific knowledge and forensic practices that need to be understood and that can be brought to bear on the evaluation of criminal cases, both for the prosecution and defense. Chapter one offers a brief introduction to sleep and sleep disorders, and Chapter two introduces essential forensic issues such as legal standards for admissibility of scientific evidence in court, the duty of the expert witness, and constraints put on expert witnesses. Chapter three presents basic information on parasomnias--the diagnostic category that includes sleepwalking and related disorders most often involved as a defense in criminal cases. Chapter four describes the use and abuse of polysomnography or sleep studies. Chapters five and six focus directly on the process of pretrial assessment and the gathering and presentation of direct and indirect evidence. Chapter seven includes detailed descriptions of criminal cases involving sleepwalking or sleep terror defenses for murder and attempted murder in the absence of alcohol or drugs. Chapter eight reviews the scientific evidence for a popular form of sleepwalking defense: the alcohol-induced sleepwalking or sexual-behavior-in-sleep defense. Chapter nine examines the validity and reliability of drug-related sleepwalking and sleep-driving defenses."--Preface.
